・Learned
What was learned was to associate the asynchronous 
communication fetch with the user operation click. 
The click of a button was made to generate a sequential API request.

・Struggle
I struggled with getting the city from the input in 5days and 3hours, and solved the problem by clicking on the 5days card and using the same city name in the 3hours detail section, but getting the information entered in the current input form.
